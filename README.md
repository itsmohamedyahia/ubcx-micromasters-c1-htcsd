My Solved Assignments of [How to Code - Simple Data](https://www.edx.org/course/how-to-code-simple-data) course on Edx.

## ðŸŽ¾ ABOUT THE COURSE

[How to Code - Simple Data](https://www.edx.org/course/how-to-code-simple-data) is the first course of the [UBCx Software Development MicroMasters](https://www.edx.org/micromasters/ubcx-software-development) and the first course of the [Core CS section](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science#core-cs) in the [OSSU CS curriculum](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science) targeted to self-taught developers.

## ðŸŽ¾ MY THOUGHTS ON THE COURSE

I was first intrigued by the logic behind the HtDF recipe and how well-structured it is for designing functions. Each step helps in producing the succeeding step in the design process, even if a step seems useless.

For example, when Professor Kiczales introduced the stub method, I thought it was just an extra step that wasn't much necessary but later on, I found how this step is very important in testing how well-formed the test examples for checking the validity of a function. At the end of the course, I came to appreciate every step used in the design process. Overall, Professor Kiczales delivered the course exceptionally well, and I learned so much from this course.

## ðŸŽ¾ WHAT I LEARNED FROM THE COURSE

- A systematic approach to solve complex problems by breaking them into simpler problems.

- Test driven development: Writing tests first to ensure we fully understand the problem, get an insight of how the problem needs to be solved, and ensure the problem is correctly and fully solved.

- How to design data from real world information and basic data structures: We should not be limited by the data structures provided by our environment, but rather we can create data structures that more closely represent real world information.

- Basic algorithms: Recursion and how we can solve common problems using algorithms that do simple tasks (like sorting by comparing only two elements).
