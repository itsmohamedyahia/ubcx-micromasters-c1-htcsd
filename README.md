# how-to-code-simple-data-assigments

My Solved Assignments of [How to Code - Simple Data](https://www.edx.org/course/how-to-code-simple-data) course on Edx.

## ðŸŽ¾ ABOUT THE COURSE

How to Code - Simple Data is the first course of the [UBCx Software Development MicroMasters](https://www.edx.org/micromasters/ubcx-software-development) and the first course of the [Core CS section](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science#core-cs) in the [OSSU CS curriculum](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science) targeted to self-taught developers.

## ðŸŽ¾ MY THOUGHTS ON THE COURSE

I was first intrigued by the logic behind the HtDF (How to design functions) recipe and how well-structured it is for designing functions. Each step helps in producing the subsequent step in the design process, even if a step seems useless.

For example, when Professor Kiczales introduced the stub method, I thought it was just an extra step that wasn't much necessary but later on, I found how this step is very important in testing how well-formed the test examples are. 

Some function design patterns such as recursion, which dont seem very trivial in normal function design, were very trivial following the HtDf recipe.

At the end of the course, I came to appreciate every step used in the design process. Overall, Professor Kiczales delivered the course exceptionally well, and I learned so much from this course.

## ðŸŽ¾ WHAT I LEARNED FROM THE COURSE

- A systematic approach to solve complex problems by breaking them into simpler problems.

- Test driven development: Writing tests first can serve as examples of the function output in addition to being tests, and it aids in designing the function body.

- How to covert real world information to data in a way that makes interpretting them back to information easy.
